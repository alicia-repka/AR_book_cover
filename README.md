# AR_book_cover

Unity software to create an augmented reality book cover for J.R.R. Tolkein's The Fellowship of the Ring.
This program tracks the front cover and overlays a 3-D depiction of the illustration, along with title and author name. 
The program also tracks the back cover and overlays revelant publication information. On the back cover, there is an augmented reality "See Review" push putton that can be selected using a mobile interface. When the button is pressed, the publication information is replaced by a short review of the book, and the "See Review" button is replaced with a "Hide review" button. When the "Hide Review" button is pressed, the back cover display returns to the original publication information.


To run this code, download all files and open as a new project in Unity. Ensure that a compatible version of the Vuforia Engine is installed.
